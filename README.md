<h3>Python</h3>
<p><strong>Assignment for:</strong> Programming Fundamentals in Python<br>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> To develop a program to manage students at an educational institution. The program doesn't need to have a graphical interface, it can just work based on inputs as implemented in the example code.<br>
<strong>Final Grade:</strong> 19.30/20</p>

<h3>EDA & ML Projects</h3>
<p>This folder contains the work for two disciplines on the <strong>bank_data</strong> dataset:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (ADE)</strong> – covers data collection, summary statistics, analysis of categorical and numerical variables, data cleaning (missing values, duplicates, outliers), correlations, multivariate analysis, feature engineering, clustering, and data transformation.</li>
  <li><strong>Part 2: Machine Learning Models (MML)</strong> – implements and tests classification models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM) to predict the binary target <strong>y</strong> (term deposit subscription).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Grades:</strong> ADE – 18.40; MML – 18.00</p>

<h3>DL & Computer Vision</h3>
<p>This project aims to develop a binary image classifier capable of distinguishing between dogs and cats using a curated dataset. It involves constructing, training, and evaluating multiple deep learning architectures—such as convolutional neural networks—to identify the best-performing model in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.<br>
<strong>Final Grade:</strong> 20/20</p>

<h3>NLP Project</h3>
<p>This project uses the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/data" target="_blank">Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset</a> from Kaggle. We conducted an exploratory analysis of US Airways tweets, including data cleaning, sentiment distribution visualization, and feature engineering, then built and evaluated classification models to predict tweet sentiment.<br>
<strong>Final Grade:</strong> 20/20</p>
